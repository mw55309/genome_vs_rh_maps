# Plot Genomic co-ords vs RH map co-ords

This is almost completely untested, it worked for our data and I have tried to make it generalise-able to other data sets.

First we generate some simulated data, then do the plot.

If you wrangle your own data into a similar format, the remaining code should work.

This is R code.
